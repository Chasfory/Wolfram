# Wolfram
The goal of this project is to implement Wolfram's elementary cellular automaton in the terminal.  
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton  

Only rule 30, rule 90 and rule 110 have been made.  
The space your cellular automaton lives in is infinite (left, right, and bottom).  
This means that parts not shown on screen can still have an effect on future generations.
**This program is in langage Haskell**
